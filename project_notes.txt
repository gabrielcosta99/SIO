For example, to retrieve the products bought by a user with UserId 1:

    SELECT Products.* 
    FROM Products
    JOIN UserProducts ON Products.Id = UserProducts.ProductId
    WHERE UserProducts.UserId = 1;

This query selects all columns from the 'Products' table for products associated with the user 
with 'UserId' 1 in the 'UserProducts' table.

By establishing this relationship and using the junction table, you can keep track of which 
products each user has purchased while maintaining data integrity in your database.
